# sigtalk

School 21 project<br>
Learning Unix signals

## Status

IN PROGRESS

## Description

The goal is to create two programms commuicating with Unix signals only.<br>

### How it works

<b>Sigtalk_server</b> must be launched first, it displays its PID.
<b>Sigtalk_client</b> takes as parameters the sigtalk_server's PID and the string to send.
Sigtalk_client communicates this string to sigtalk_server, then sigtalk_server displays it.<br><br>
Unicode  characters are supported.
